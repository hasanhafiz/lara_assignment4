This week you'll build a simple banking app. We're providing you the HTML template. You just need to make it functional with PHP. 

The features are simple. 

There are two types of users: 'Admin' and 'Customer'. 

Admin Features
    See all transactions made by all users.
    Search and view transactions by a specific user using their email.
    View a list of all registered customers.
    Customer Features
    Customers can register using their name, email, and password.
    Customers can log in using their registered email and password.
    See a list of all of their transactions.
    Deposit money to their account.
    Withdraw money from their account.
    Transfer money to another customer's account by specifying their email address.
    See the current balance of their account.

Note: 
    Use OOP concepts.
    Use 'File' for storage.
    You’ll need to use ‘Session’ for the Logged in users functionality.
    You must use ‘Composer’ to autoload your files. Also, make sure to use Namespaces.
    You must share your Github repo link for this submission.
